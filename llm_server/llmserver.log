E:\Python\Lib\site-packages\huggingface_hub\file_download.py:142: UserWarning: `huggingface_hub` cache-system uses symlinks by default to efficiently store duplicated files but your machine does not support them in C:\Users\PC\.cache\huggingface\hub\models--NV9523--CHAT_SVY. Caching files will still work but in a degraded version that might require more space on your disk. This warning can be disabled by setting the `HF_HUB_DISABLE_SYMLINKS_WARNING` environment variable. For more details, see https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/how-to-cache#limitations.
To support symlinks on Windows, you either need to activate Developer Mode or to run Python as an administrator. In order to activate developer mode, see this article: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development

This probably means that you're loading a configuration file that was saved using a higher version of the library and additional parameters have been introduced since. It is highly recommended to upgrade the PEFT version before continuing (e.g. by running `pip install -U peft`).

The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
